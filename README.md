# Sintax Highlighter
 In this program, lexical categories of programming languages are defined, which are analyzed through a regular expression engine that reads an input source code, then an HTML file is created in which the source code is shown, classifying each one of the lexical families found in the source code.


HOW TO RUN:

1. Place the C++ Source Code inside the folder "entradas". It can be many files. 
2. Using the WSL Console, open the program main folder.
3. Run the file main.cpp 
4. If all went well, there must have been a HTML file generated. Open It. 
5. That's it. Thanks for using Syntax Hightlighter
